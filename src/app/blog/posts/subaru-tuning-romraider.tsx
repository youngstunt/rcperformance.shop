      <Paragraph>
        Before you start making any changes, it is essential to datalog your vehicle's stock performance. This will give you a baseline to compare against and help you identify any potential issues. ROMRaider's built-in datalogger makes it easy to record and analyze a wide range of parameters, including engine speed, throttle position, boost pressure, and air-fuel ratio.

        Once you have a good understanding of your vehicle's stock performance, you can start making small changes to the ECU maps. It is important to make one change at a time and to datalog after each change to ensure that you are not causing any harm to your engine.

        Tuning your vehicle's ECU can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be dangerous if you do not know what you are doing. It is important to do your research and to understand the risks involved before you start making any changes. If you are not comfortable tuning your own vehicle, it is best to leave it to a professional.
